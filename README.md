# OOPS in C++ – Practice Programs (1 to 16)

This repository contains **16 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** practice programs written in **C++**.

Only the `.cpp` source files (`OOPS-1.cpp` to `OOPS-16.cpp`) are included.  
Executable files (`.exe`), text files (`.txt`), and other unrelated source files have been intentionally excluded.
